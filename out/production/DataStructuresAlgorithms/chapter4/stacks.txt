/*

A stack allows access to only one data item: the last item inserted.
If you remove this item, you can access the next-to-last item inserted, and so on.


- Push - Placing a data item on top of the stack is called pushing it.
- Popping - Removing it from the top of the stack is called popping it.
- A stack is said to be a Last-In-First-Out(LIFO) storage mechanism
where the last item inserted is the first one to be removed.
- Peek - Read the value from the top of the stack without removing it
